# Foove

## Description

This project makes the daily chore of deciding what to cook a little easier by picking a recipe for its user while simultaneously generating a playlist to promote a fun mood. The project was supposed to feature two APIs: the Spoonacular API for fetching recipes and the Spotify API for curating playlists. The Spotify API is not functioning in the project's current state, so only a recipe will be provided upon user interaction.
